# Phase 2 Project Description
# Overview
Like many other industries, the movie industry was feared to fail in the midst of the global pandemic that gripped the world in 2020. While 2020 and 2021 proved to be especially tricky years for the industry, it has since recovered to pre-2020 levels and is expected to continue to grow strongly throughout the rest of the decade. Therefore, it would be prudent to investigate the viability of creating a new studio, which would not only contribute to the increased market capitalisation of the industry but more importantly, would allow more original stories to be told.

G2 corp. has been successful in the various ventures that it has had a stake in, however this does not guarantee success in its future ventures. Thus it is vital to conduct analysis to help determine what type of movies, targeted at which markets and produced by which director in order to maximise the chance of success.

# Business Understanding
## Problem Statement
G2 corp. has expressed interest in creating a movie studio, however the organisation lacks expertise in this field. This project aims to assist the organisation in determining a variety of factors, primarily: What genre of movies should be produced, What markets should be targeted, Which directors should be contracted, How much budget should be allocated to the movies based on the genre.

## Expected Benefits
Through the analysis of the available data, the organisation will have the ability to make an data-informed decision about the kind of movies to produce in order to maximise the chances of success

## Business Success Criteria
Success of the project will be evaluated through the execution of the recommendations made after the analysis has been completed.

## Assessment
The data available is fragmented into 4 different data sources from Box Office Mojo, IMDB, TheMovieDB and The Numbers. This data contains information about the movie itself, financial data as well as how the movie was received.

The risk of this project comes down to the nature of movies. Movies are a piece of art and like any other artform, it is difficult to engineer the success of a movie. The right combination of genre, budget and director may still produce a film that is unsuccessful financially. Therefore while this analysis will be important and necessary, it cannot be treated as the single key to success.

## Project Goals
- Combine and clean the datasets
- Analyse the data based on the criteria that contribute to a movieâ€™s success
- Identify genres, regions, budgets and (WRITERS) that will likely produce artistically and financially successful movies
- Provide final recommendations to stakeholders

## Project Success Criteria 
The project will be considered a success upon the recommendation of a combination of region, director, budget and (WRITERS) for specific genres which G2 Corp. should pursue.
